There are two services implemented.

__limited_f__: A service receives a request and responds in 1 second.

__Intermediary__: The service which receives requests, prioritizes, and send to _limited_f_ service.

And there is python file named _tester.py_ when run sends a bunch of requests to the service _Intermediary_.
